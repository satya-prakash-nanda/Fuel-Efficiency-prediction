## Tractor Fuel Efficiency Prediction Model ðŸšœ

## Overview

This project aims to predict the fuel consumption and fuel efficiency of tractors using various parameters such as load percentage, speed, area covered, horsepower, soil type, and terrain conditions. A machine learning model is built, evaluated, and deployed as a web application using Streamlit to make predictions accessible and user-friendly.



## Features
Synthetic Dataset Generation: Generates random samples with parameters like implement type, speed, load, and horsepower.

Outlier Detection and Removal: Uses the IQR method to ensure clean and accurate data.

Machine Learning Model: Trained on Random Forest and other algorithms to predict fuel efficiency.

Web Application: Users can interactively input tractor parameters to get predictions for fuel consumption and efficiency.

Analytics Dashboard: Visualizations to analyze trends and insights from the dataset.
