Tractor Fuel Efficiency Prediction Model ðŸšœ

Overview

This project aims to predict the fuel consumption and fuel efficiency of tractors using various parameters such as load percentage, speed, area covered, horsepower, soil type, and terrain conditions. A machine learning model is built, evaluated, and deployed as a web application using Streamlit to make predictions accessible and user-friendly.
